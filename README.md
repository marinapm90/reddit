I am pretty sure that at least once in your life you have wondered when is the best time to post on Reddit, and if that is not the case, I am pretty sure that you are now asking yourself the question.

Well, this project tries to solve that problem.

How?

Analyzing the latest posts and scores.

Python Libraries:
requests
pandas
datetime
numpy
functools

A [requirements.txt](https://github.com/marinapm90/reddit/blob/master/requirements.txt) file is included in the repository for easy installation

Set UP:


To use it you just need to run:

``` python3 best_moments.py```

And it will ask you which subreddit do you want to parse.

example:

Imagine you want to analyze https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/ 

Just type "learnpython"
